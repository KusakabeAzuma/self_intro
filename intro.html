            Here I would like to look back on the five years I spent at NIT Tsuyama.<br>
            My memories of my freshman year are about dormitory life. It was difficult to do many things for the first time. <br>
            However, my friends who overcame the same difficulties are still my friends today. <br>
            We were scared the guidance dorm students.<br>
            My memory from my second year is learning about programming in the information systems department. <br>
            The third year laboratory training was very difficult. Especially the handwritten reports were very time consuming. <br>
            Therefore, I stayed up all night every Sunday.<br>
            <img src="PHP_sakubun.jpeg" width="403" height="302" ><br>
            The photo above shows the award I received when I was in my third year. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that I am a fifth grade, I have begun my job search and am spending every day in a fulfilling way. <br>
            However, I am tired of all the things that have been happening lately. <br>
            I will do my best every day without overexerting myself so as not to damage my body. <br>
            I would like to end by leaving here a line from my favorite game.<br>
